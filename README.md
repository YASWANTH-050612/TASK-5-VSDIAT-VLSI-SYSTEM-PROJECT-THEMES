# Final Documentation: UART Transmitter with Sensor Data Integration

## Objective:
To integrate a UART transmitter with a sensor to allow FPGA-based transmission of real-time sensor data to an external device.

---

## 1. Issue with Sensor Availability:
Due to the lack of nearby sensors in my area, I adapted the project by simulating the sensor data, ensuring the overall functionality of the system remained intact.

---

## 2. Steps Involved:

### 2.1 Understanding the Code:
- I analyzed the Verilog code, focusing on how sensor data is acquired and transmitted over UART. I integrated the FPGA with the sensor and UART components.

### 2.2 Design:
- Created a block diagram showing how the sensor integrates with the UART transmitter, illustrating data flow through the system.  
- Developed a circuit diagram depicting the sensor-to-FPGA connection and the UART TX connection to the receiving device.

### 2.3 Implementation:
- Despite the sensor availability issue, I simulated the sensor data and proceeded with FPGA synthesis and programming using Vivado.

### 2.4 Testing:
- I simulated varying sensor inputs and verified data transmission by observing serial terminal output on a connected device.

## Conclusion:
I successfully implemented a UART-based data transmission system using FPGA, simulating the sensor data. The output was as expected, confirming the system's functionality.
